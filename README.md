</picture> Introduction :</h2><i>
<ul>
<li>Cyber bullying is harassing or insulting a person by sending messages of hurting or threatening nature using electronic communication.Present methods to automatically determine the bully level, and block post and users of the post by the utilizing deep learning on pre-trained language models with annotated data to create automated cyber bullying detectors.
</li>
  </ul>

</picture> Problem Statement :</h2></div>
<ul>
<li> Cyber bullying is aggressive, abusive behavior towards a person or a group of people intentionally, repeatedly harming them by spending offensive content or engaging in other forms of social violence through using social media.

  The biggest challenge is that cyber bullying can quickly spread as there’s a large audience and stay visible for a longer time. 
  
  Cyber bullying is a modern phenomenon as victims have to face lots of consequences. 
  
  It has caused major issues to mental and physical health.
  
  Study about effects of bullying is present but implementation for monitoring social network to detect cyber bullying activities is less.
  </ul>

</picture> Proposed Solution :</h2></div>
<ul>
<li> This proposed a system for automatic detection and prevention cyberbullying considering the main characteristics of cyberbullying such as Intention to harm an individual.
  Repeatedly and over time and using abusive curl language or hate speech using BiLSTM algorithm. 
 This approach is based on a bag of words and TFIDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) approach. 
 These features are used to train deep learning BiLSTM classifiers. 
 The Bullied level encapsulates the level of cyberbullying in a given digital environment.

  </ul>
